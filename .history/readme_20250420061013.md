## Project Overview

This project analyzes heatwave data to:
- Detect extreme heatwave events.
- Cluster heatwaves based on spatio-temporal characteristics.
- Visualize heatwave clusters and their distributions.

The scripts in this repository are designed to process large datasets, perform clustering using algorithms like K-Means and UPGMA, and generate insightful visualizations.
